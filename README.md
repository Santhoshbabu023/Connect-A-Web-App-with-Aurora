# Connect-A-Web-App-with-Aurora
This project connects a simple web application to **Amazon Aurora**, a fully managed relational database service by AWS. The app allows users to interact with a **MySQL** database hosted on Amazon Aurora by adding and updating data through the browser. The web app is built using **PHP** and **MySQLi** for database interactions.
